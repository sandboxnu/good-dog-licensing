# Schema

This directory contains the schema definitions for the endpoints and frontend forms. These schemas should be shared between the backend and frontend to simplify validation

Try to organize the schemas in a way that makes sense, and then export them in the [index.ts](./index.ts) file. This will allow you to import them easily in other files.
